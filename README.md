iOS Client for Indicative's REST API

This REST client creates a JSON representation of your event and posts it to Indicative's Event endpoint.

Features:

+ No external dependencies, so you'll never have library conflicts.
+ Asynchronous, designed to never slow down or break your app.
+ Fault tolerent: if network connectivity is lost, events are queued and retried.

Sample usage:

    // In the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method of your main app   
    // delegate, call the launch: method with your project's API key. 
    // You can find yours by logging in to indicative.com and navigating
    // to the Project Settings page.
    
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        [Indicative launch:@"Your-API-Key-Goes-Here"];
    }
    
    // To record an event, first call the createEvent:withUniqueId: method, passing in the name of your event 
    // and a unique identifier for the user associated with the event. For example:
    
    Event *event = [Event createEvent:@"Registration" withUniqueId:@"user47"];

    // Next, add properties by calling addProperty:withValue: on your newly created event, like so:

    [event addProperty:@"Gender" withValue:@"Male"];
    [event addProperty:@"Age" withValue:@"23"];
    
    // Finally, when youâ€™re done adding properties, call the recordEvent: method and pass in your event:

    [Indicative recordEvent:event];

You should modify and extend this class to your heart's content.  If you make any changes please send a pull request!

As a best practice, consider adding a method that takes as a parameter the object representing your user, and adds certain default properties based on that user's characteristics (e.g., gender, age, etc.).
